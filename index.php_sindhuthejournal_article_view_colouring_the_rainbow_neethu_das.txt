Abstract
This article briefly explores the caste politics visible in the queer relationship represented in the movie
Geeli Pucchi
(Sloppy Kisses), the third film in the Netflix anthology film
Ajeeb Daastaans
(Untold Stories, Hindi, 2021). The article attempts to discuss how the plurality of queer identities is generally erased and appropriated as a global ‘gay’ identity which is rich, cis, male and savarna in Indian representations on same sex love. The two active trajectories of Queer Movement which are assimilational and oppositional in certain Indian queer representations as the case studies are examined, focusing on
Geeli Pucchi
. It can be argued that Indian Queer Movement, which is necessarily against the right wing, Hindutva politics can be seen upholding the same value system by reflecting the Brahmanic and patriarchal propaganda in Literature. By presenting certain examples from Indian representations of same sex love, the paper would substantiate the above arguments. The paper would study Geeli Pucchi as a movie which explored the everyday banality of same sex relationships in India, at the same time critiquing in a political perspective.
