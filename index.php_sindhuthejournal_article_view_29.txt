Abstract
Shruti Sareen’s debut full-length poetry collection
A Witch Like You
is a collection of emotions traversing in the liminal spaces of time and space that is filled with nostalgia. In the “Acknowledgements,” she elucidates the origins of the title as being part of a dream and further explains how this “ambiguous” (4) word indicates being bewitched, entranced, influenced which is neither good nor bad, positive nor negative, right nor wrong (4). This in fact reflects the essence of this collection, which floats between these extremes of good and evil, narrating her myriad experiences from different stages of her life.
